    "Jupyter Notebook is a fantastic tool for data exploration, enabling analysts to write documents that contain software code, computational output, formatted text and data visualizations. Visualization is a big component of the data exploration process, and can be frequently found in Jupyter Notebooks: for example, a recent study of public GitHub repositories found that *matplotlib* was the second most imported package in the notebook environment \\cite{pimentel2019large}.\n",

    "When datasets are too large or too complex, interactive visualization becomes a useful tool in exploratory data analysis. Interactive visualizations can enable, among many others, the display of information at multiple levels of detail, the exploration of data using coordinated views, and the dynamic change of the charts to focus on the user's interests. While Jupyter Notebooks can contain interactive visualizations, the vast majority of charts produced in the environment are static.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we will present three simple and powerful approaches in which data scientists can create interactive visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks: *matplotlib* callbacks, visualization toolkits and custom HTML embedding. The three approaches offer a number of benefits and drawbacks that need to be considered by the developer in order for them to make an informed decision about their visualization project. By the end of this paper, the reader will have a good understanding of the three methods, and will be able to select an implementation approach depending on the level of interaction, customization and data flow desired."

    "**Matplotlib Callbacks.** The *matplotlib* library \\cite{hunter2007matplotlib} is the most popular general purpose visualization package for Jupyter Notebooks \\cite{pimentel2019large}. This tool enables the creation static, animated, and interactive visualizations, that can be rendered directly as the output of notebook cells.  However, the available user interactions are limited: there is support for click and keypress events, but drag-and-drop, tooltips, and cross-filtering, frequently supported in visualization tools, are not directly provided. To expand the possible user interactions, [*ipywidgets*](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io) can be used. *ipywidgets* is a library that provides HTML form inputs in the Jupyter interface, including  drop down menus, text boxes, and sliders.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualization Toolkits.** In order to enable the creation of more interactive visualizations in Python and Jupyter Notebooks, many open source visualization toolkits have been developed. Among those, Perkel and others \\cite{perkel2018data} highlight [*Plotly*](https://plotly.com/), [*Bokeh*](https://bokeh.org/) and [*Altair*](https://altair-viz.github.io/). These libraries are built on top of web technologies, and create visualizations that can be seen in web browsers. Syntax-wise, *Plotly* and *Bokeh* are very similar to *matplotlib*. However, both libraries have been developed with a focus on user interaction, enabling the creation of web-based dashboards that combine interactive widgets and charts, and support multiple user inputs, including click, drag-and-drop, tooltips, selection, crossfilter, and bidirectional communication with Python via callbacks. *Altair* \\cite{vanderplas2018altair} differs from the aforementioned libraries in the way visualizations are defined: it uses a declarative specification that ports  VEGA-Lite \\cite{satyanarayan2016vega}, a data visualization grammar, to Python. A wide range of interactive visualizations can be expressed using a small number of Altair primitives, making this library very flexible. However, the produced visualizations cannot communicate with Python and therefore the results of user interactions cannot be used in further computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom HTML Embedding.** There might be cases when a visualization cannot be created using any off-the-shelf Python libraries. When this happens, the developer/researcher has the option to write their own visualization using a web framework, and embed this visualization in Jupyter Notebooks. This option offers the most flexibility, as the visualization can be fully customized and interactions can be scripted on demand. JavaScript libraries such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) can be used to facilitate the implementation of custom visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 summarizes the different approaches to add interactive visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks. The approaches are classified in terms of interaction, type of output, level of customization, support for dashboards, and data flow. When creating a new visualization, we believe these properties should be taken into consideration."
